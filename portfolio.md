<!-- ### Ruby-Connect

Collaborative project building an SMS game of Connect Four using Sinatra and Twilio. Part of Ruby Monday, an ongoing group-project through CodeNewbie.org.

My first contribution is to pair with another member to build out the game interface. -->

<!-- ### Rummikub

First collaborative project undertaken with a friend from CodeNewbie-ATX. -->

<!-- ### RottenPotatoes

The over-arching project from UC Berkeley's MOOC 'Engineering Software as a Service' teaches the Agile workflow by requiring students to build a restful social network application for movie reviews reminiscent of RottenTomatoes.com. The project builds over several weeks, with most of the front end being supplied in the boilerplate code.

### Twitter Clone (RailsTutorial)

The classic rite-of-passage for aspiring Rails Developers, I approached Hartl's Rails Tutorial as a crash course overview before diving deep into the various topics using The Odin Project. You'll notice a branch in my git repo where I've decided to translate the MiniTest suite to RSpec, not out of any sort of preference but just to enhance my understanding of both tools.
