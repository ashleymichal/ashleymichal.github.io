### Twitter Clone (RailsTutorial)

The classic rite-of-passage for aspiring Rails Developers, I approached Hartl's Rails Tutorial as a crash course overview before diving deep into the various topics using The Odin Project. You'll notice a branch in my git repo where I've decided to translate the MiniTest suite to RSpec, not out of any sort of preference but just to enhance my understanding of both tools.

<!-- ### Typo (Working with 'Legacy' Code)

The over-arching project from UC Berkeley's MOOC 'Engineering Software as a Service, pt 2' teaches the Agile workflow by requiring students to iterate over the TDD workflow with an existing web application, in this case [Typo](#), a weblog CMS. The project builds over several weeks, focusing on refactoring, project management, and maintenance.

<!-- ### RottenPotatoes

The over-arching project from UC Berkeley's MOOC 'Engineering Software as a Service pt 1' teaches the Agile workflow by requiring students to build a restful social network application for movie reviews reminiscent of RottenTomatoes.com.
