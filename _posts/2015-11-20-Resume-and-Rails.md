title: Resume and Rails
---

10:07 - I took the day off of work today for another Career Coaching session in preparation for Women Who Code's Tech Interview Workshop tomorrow. I'm pretty excited for this potential glimpse into the interview process.

I've spent a decent amount of time tinkering with my resume, and while I think it looks good, it feels like a shell of a thing and a testament to how much further I have to go before I can present myself as a potential asset to any company. My list of applications is wanting and kind of just full of tutorial projects from BerkeleyX and RailsTutorial. All in good time, I suppose.

Speaking of BerkeleyX, they released the last week of material the other day. I'm excited, but I don't think I'll be signing up to take this for credit. I fell behind (40 hr work week + university level coursework is difficult to keep up with) but I'll definitely be signing up for part 2 of this amazing course!

Wish me luck!

PS: on a barely related note, CodeNewbie just did a podcast on ['Hello Ruby'](http://www.helloruby.com/ "Hello Ruby"), a cute book geared towards teaching children about programming culture and problem solving before they ever see a screen. It looks awesome, and I hope to see it catch on.
