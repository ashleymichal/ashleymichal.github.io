title: Exceptions
---

Seizing the opportunity to try using a little exception handling in my [Tic Tac Toe Game][1]. There's really only one place for this to go, which is in the player input part of the game. It was nice to work through this problem and actually understand "hmm, I think I need some exception handling here" and then slip it in there with little hassle. I could probably improve upon it by throwing an exception when a space is filled and then handling that exception differently. Perhaps after I figure out Mastermind....
