title: Code Newbies Austin

16:08 - Right after I got back from NYC in September, I started attending the Austin chapter of Code Newbie's local Meetups. I've really enjoyed the podcasts, and the prospect of hanging out with other learners was significantly less intimidating than some of the other dev meetups in the area; at least I knew that I wouldn't be totally lost in the conversation.

Because of that little confidence boost, I felt comfortable going to my first Women Who Code Meetup a few weeks later and met a couple of pretty kickass ladies. I now look forward to these events, which do a lot to both stimulate my brain and to feed my desire for social interaction beyond what I can get at home or at work. I love my fiance, and my co-workers, but because I've been trying to immerse myself in development and code, conversations feel limited because all I really want to talk about is duck-typing or SaaS or whatever topic I've been most recently introduced to.

And sometimes beer and coffee. But mostly I'd rather drink them while talking about Ruby.
