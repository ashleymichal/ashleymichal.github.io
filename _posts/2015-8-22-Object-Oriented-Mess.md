title: Object-Oriented Mess

18:20 - I'm in the middle of the Mastermind project in TOP, and I'm... well I'm not stuck, but the code is starting to feel cob-webby. My classes feel bloated, I feel like I'm making things more complicated than they should be, and just.... ugh. I can finish it the way it is now, but am I adding into a crummy program? I feel like I don't have a good metric for this...
