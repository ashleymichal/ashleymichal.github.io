13:42 - Today I learned how fast the word changes.  Trying to use "Learn Ruby" with test-driven development strategy.  Super excited.  Only problem, this curriculum uses a deprecated version of rspec, rails, AND ruby.  So gonna have to downgrade all.  Also rake seems to be failing. Wooooooo.

Speaking of which, I need to remember to enter the following when I'm done with this project:

		rvm use ruby-2.2.1
		
Or I'll be stuck in the past!

17:23 - I've decided to just use their stupid online environment to actually DO today's lesson rather than take the slow, painful detour down the path of.... whatever.
