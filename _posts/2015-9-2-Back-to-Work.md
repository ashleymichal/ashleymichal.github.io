11:15 - I took a break from development to move to our permanant apartment. I won't gush too much, but it's kind of perfect; exactly what we need right now, no more no less. The kitchen is bitchin', the bedroom is huge, the living room is cozy, the whole place has fantastic flow, there's a good-sized balcony which is very private, the apartment complex is dog-friendly, and best of all, the location cuts at least 15 minutes and all the traffic out of Ben's commute.

However, four days later, I am writing this from my seat on a flight back to New York for Fashion Week. Yup, it's that time again. Gotta rake in a little dough to replenish the savings account. It's a little bit frustrating though, since I feel like I just made our new apartment into our new home, that I have to be away from it for three. whole. weeks. Ugh.

I've also decided to skip ahead in The Odin Project to a little bit of front-end development. I'm finding more and more that the smaller projects I could pick up on Upwork or Craigslist are primarily front-end and UI/UX. I'm going to try bouncing back and forth so the Ruby stays fresh but I can maybe start pulling in a little cash here and there to fund my "unemployment".

I'm also looking forward to my first Career Coaching session when I get back. I think I'll have something to work with! I need to keep my eyes out for good Meetups too. I wonder if it's poor etiquette to attend a Meetup in NYC when I don't actually live there..?
