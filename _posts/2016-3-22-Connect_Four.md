title: Connect Four
---

13:25 - After lots of time in what I like to call the "exploratory" mode of learning, last week I recommitted to the Odin Project curriculum and decided to go back to a couple of projects that I was a bit hasty with.

Worth it. 

Today I finished my first version of Connect Four. The curriculum asks that you first stumble through testing an old implementation (your own) of Tic Tac Toe, then 'it should be easy to build Connect Four now'.

Well... my first version of Tic Tac Toe was a mess, and I was struggling to understand how to lay out that project, much less Connect Four.

So I followed a tutorial that approached Tic Tac Toe as a gem and found that the process was super helpful. After taking ample notes on the process, I then adapted the format to the rules of Connect Four and fleshed out a quick little script to access from the command line. To do: Documentation and a proper command line tool.

The following resources were indispensible:
