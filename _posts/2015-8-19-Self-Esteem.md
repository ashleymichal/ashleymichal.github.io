17:19 - I have to say, job-hunting and learning programming are difficult things to do in tandem. By difficult, I primarily mean uncomfortable. Job-hunting obviously because it is stressful, full of rejection, and throwing in a career change on top of the usual stress means a lot of trudging through self-doubt to try and promote yourself as someone who is worth taking a chance on.

And then of course I decide to also try programming. So smart. I'm (slowly) learning a thing or two about self-discipline and it's embarrassing because I didn't think it would be so much. I also *want* to attend Meetups, I want there to be more, but they seem to be inaccessible one way or another.
