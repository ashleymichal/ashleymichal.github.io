Jan 23, 20:48 - OK to flesh this out, back in August, I put all of my Odin Project assignments into one massive repo.

In hindsight, this was not a good idea. I want to be able to easily guide someone to an individual project in my repo, and I also want to be able to update and view the documentation for each with relative ease as I put together my case studies.

So I googled it, and came up with the above stack overflow result. Now all of my Rails apps are nestled happily in their own little repos, and, this is important, they retain all of their commit histories.

I'm one step closer to organizational nirvana.
