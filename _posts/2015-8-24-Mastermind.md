16:10 - Subclassing! I've got two kinds of "code" object for my Mastermind game.  They're both constructed in the same way, but one of them relies on a second object for comparison to determine how good a match they are.

22:18 - Finished. The project works well enough, though the instructions for the AI portion of the project sort of aren't in keeping with the game mechanics. It could be a fun exercise later on, but for now, I'm just excited that my two games are complete and I can move into I/O!
